## Week 2

Didn't have much time this week
1. Research math for the wind simulation and grass blade deformation

## Week 3

1. Fixes from feedback + wrap up basics from before.
2. Class diagram and Design.md
3. Refactor code to use `ngl::Vec3` instead of `Point`.
4. Implement and test orientation vectors of grass blade segments in `Blade`.

## Week 4
